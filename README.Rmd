# positrans: Positron transition

> As someone working with R and used to VS Code (or RStudio), I want to know 
how to transition to Positron smoothly, so that I can more easily collaborate 
with colleagues comming from RStudio (or VS Code).

Positron is a polyglot IDE with great support for R. Because it's similar in 
many ways to both VS Code and RStudio, it's an excellent meeting point for 
those comming from either IDE. However, Positron is also different in many ways
to both VS Code and RStudio, so the transition will come with some pain.

To reduce that pain and stay productive, you can taste Positron or start 
preparing for the transition with relatively small and few changes to your 
current workflow from the comfort of your favorite IDE.

## Positron

[Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) includes:

* Tools for data science: 
  * R console
  * Ability to send R code from scripts to the console with ctrl+enter.
  * Panels to explore plots and data.
  * Support for Quarto
* Tools for software development:
  * Keyboard shortcuts for building R packages with devtools
  * Support for Shiny
  * Testing
* Tools for debugging R code.

You can enable [RSdudio keyboard shortcuts](https://positron.posit.co/keyboard-shortcuts.html#rstudio-keymap), e.g.:

* Send code to the R console: ctrl+enter
* Restart R: ctrl+shift+0
* Assign `<-`: alt+-
* Pipe `|>`: ctrl+M
* Develop R packages using the devtools workflow: 
  * `load_all()`: ctrl+shift+L
  * `test()`: ctrl+shift+T
  * `document()`: ctrl+shift+D
  * `check()`: ctrl+shift+E

## VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes with little support
for R, but these few extensios and keyboard shortcuts approximate Positron's
experience for R.

* Extensions:

```
# Basic R support, e.g. send code to the R console with Ctrl+Enter 
code --install-extension reditorsupport.r
# Needs this R package
Rscript -e 'install.packages("languageserver")'

# Debug
# TODO: In VSCode command pallete run `r.debugger.updateRPackage`
code --install-extension rdebugger.r-debugger

# Test
code --install-extension hbenl.vscode-test-explorer
code --install-extension meakbiyik.vscode-r-test-adapter

# Shiny
code --install-extension posit.shiny

# Quarto
code --install-extension quarto.quarto
```

* Shortcuts: Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults: ~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json
