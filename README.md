# Approaching Positron from RStudio

Rstudio has the most complete support for R, but today many R developers
learned Python (or other languages) first and feel more comfortable
working in VS Code.

A great meeting point between R developers comming from RStudio and VS
Code is Positron, because it has great support for R, and is similar to
both RStudio and VS Code in many ways. But of course there are also some
differences that may be stopping you from trying or changing to
Positron.

Here I show how to bridge the gap between RStudio and Positron to start
the transition immediately without losing productivity. It demonstrates
how you can adapt your workflow in RStudio to prepare for Positron and
how to configure Positron to resemble RStudio.

## RStudio

Most R users come from RStudio and know what to expect from an IDE that
supports R.
